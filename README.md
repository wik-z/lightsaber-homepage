# Lightsaber opening page
### Made for White Ravens Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy clan

This was initially made as a fan opening page for the clan website, but since the website is down, I wanted to upload it somewhere. Simply because it looks cool.

This code is way older than the repository itself, so please don't judge me too much. I might re-code that soon to make myself feel better with it.

#### Preview
**Remember to click on the lightsaber hilt, it does things!**

#### Known issues
It's **not responsive**. Also, the switch-on lightsaber sound effect is way too large and causes the overall sound crash on the whole page. To be fixed with v2.
